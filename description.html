<br>It is April 6th, 1917. The United States has just declared war on Germany, bringing her into the war that has engulfed Europe for the past 3 years.
    <br>Germany and Austria-Hungary expand aggressively while the Ottomans struggle just to hold on.
    <br>Greece remains officially neutral even as Entente troops flood in to liberate their Balkan allies.
    <br>Russia struggles to hold back Germany as internal unrest tears her apart.
    <br>Britain incites the Arabs to revolt against their Ottoman overlords while moving troops to assist France.
    <br>Unless the United States does the same, the Central Powers will soon overrun Europe.
